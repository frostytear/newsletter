# NodeSchool Newsletter #2

Welcome to the second NodeSchool newsletter! [NodeSchool](http://nodeschool.io/) is a 100% volunteer run open source project with chapters around the world. We use Node to build automated workshops that teach a wide range of programming topics and host free or affordable events to promote coding education.

### New workshops: how-to-npm and learn-generators

We recently added two new workshops, the first is called [how-to-npm](https://github.com/npm/how-to-npm) and is written by Isaac Schlueter and Lin Clark of npm, inc. It teaches you how to, well, npm. Check it out! Even if you think you know npm, you might learn a thing or two.

The second new workshop is called [learn-generators](https://github.com/isRuslan/learn-generators) and is written by Ruslan Ismagilov of St. Petersberg, Russia. It focuses on teaching the new Generators syntax in ES6, both for looping and also async use cases.

### New year translations

Last year in December @maxogden [tried to get NodeSchoolers to work on translation](https://github.com/nodeschool/organizers/issues/64), and we have made significant process on this front! [Workshopper](https://github.com/rvagg/workshopper), the base for a lot of content related to nodeschool, has been already translated into translated to Spanish, Portugese, French, Russian, Chinese, Taiwanese and Japanese.

Yet there is still much work to be done! Particularly [the translation of Adventure](https://github.com/substack/adventure/pull/7) is still in somewhat of a rough state. Most importantly its not compatible to how workshopper works. If you have some hands to spare: Just start hacking on it yourself and/or exchange yourself with other volunteers using [github](https://github.com/nodeschool/organizers/issues) or [Gitter](https://gitter.im/nodeschool/organizers)

Thanks for reading and see you next time! You can view our all of our newsletters [on GitHub](https://github.com/nodeschool/newsletter).
